	<div class="number">*[1]&nbsp;<span class="note">Historically, everyday objects and activities were routinely discussed in the Western philosophical tradition, not to mention many non-Western traditions. One could claim that it is a very peculiar development of twentieth century Anglo- American aesthetics, which is focused almost exclusively on art. Only against this background can we characterize recent works on everyday aesthetics as “recently emerging.” I owe this point to Ossi Naukkarinen.<span></div>

	<div class="number">*[10]&nbsp; <span class="note">The classic work on this point is Dewey’s Art as Experience. Contemporary discussion of this idea can be found in Katya Mandoki’s Everyday Aesthetics: Prosaics, the Play of Culture and Social Identities (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2007). By far the most extended and sustained development of this point is Arnold Berleant’s oeuvre spanning four decades, starting with the notions of aesthetic field and aesthetic engagement, and which developed into environmental aesthetics, which was then further developed to encompass every aspect of human life by establishing a new field of social aesthetics, as well as the aesthetic dimensions and implications of politics. His most recent work is Sensibility and Sense: The Aesthetic Transformation of the Human World (Exeter, UK: Imprint Academic, 2010).</span></div>

	<div class="number">*[44]&nbsp; <span class="note"> One could claim that artists, insofar as being engaged in art-making, are not raising the fundamental question about the very existence and importance of art-making. I am not sure whether the situation is equivalent to raising the fundamental question in artified business. It seems that many contemporary artists have raised the fundamental question about the raison d’etre of art and artworld in their work, though the irony is that whatever artistic statements they make (against art and the artworld) cannot but be subsumed under the artworld context. However, artists do have the freedom to question the status quo of art and artworld, while practitioners of artification in business and industry may be discouraged from raising such fundamental questions. After all they are employed to enhance operational success, and even if they do manage to raise such questions, it is not clear whether their challenge would be taken at face value.</span></div>
